The park provides opportunities for picnicking, hiking, and wildlife viewing.</p>

Treaties with the Kansas and Osage Indians safeguarded the Eastern end of the road but Plains tribes continued to make raids. Fort Zarah at this point was one of a chain of forts built on the trail to protect wagon trains and guard settlers. It was established in 1864 by Gen. Samuel R. Curtis and named for his son, Maj. H. Zarah Curtis, who had been killed in the Baxter Springs Massacre Oct. 6, 1863. The fort was built of sandstone quarried in nearby bluffs. Fort Zarah was successfully defended against an attack by 100 Kiowas on Oct. 2, 1868. It was abandoned in 1869."</p>

<p>Amenities at the roadside park include a shelter, picnic tables, and shade trees, as well as grassy areas for camping or picnicking.</p>

Riverside Park was the site of the Neosho Valley Fair for many years, and in 1879 President Rutherford B. Hayes visited, along with about 30,000 other people.</p>

<p>Neosho Falls was once the most important town in Woodson County, with a population topping 1200. Today, just over 100 remain, and there's not much left of the town. It was once at the intersection of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe and the Missouri, Kansas & Texas (The M-K-T or "Katy") railroads, with a large depot. The railroads left in the 1930s and 1950s, respectively, that that, along with a devastating flood that destroyed much of the town in 1951, was the end of Neosho Falls.

<p>Riverside Park provides several acres of shaded campgrounds, suitable for both RVs and tent campers. Amenities include restrooms, water, picnic tables, and grills. The cost is $12 per night for RVs and $6 per night for tents. Access is via gravel roads.</p>

Tent camping and hiking are still allowed, but vehicles must be parked outside the gate and visitors must hike in. Drinking water and a vault toilet are still provided year-round.</p>

<p>Visitors can camp in the large mowed area near the entrance to the park or along the 4.5-mile trail. There are numerous small clearings along the trail that make excellent camping spots, but the Corps of Engineers asks that people use only pre-existing campfire rings. The trail is quite scenic as it travels through woods, meadows and hay fields, and meets up with the lakeshore intermittently.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Corps of Engineers manages five <a href="http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/cl/Camping.cfm" target="_blank">additional</a> campgrounds at Clinton Lake. All of these are pay sites, and intended primarily for RVs. Prices range from $12 to $18 per night.</p>

<p>In addition, the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism manages <a href="/camping/ClintonStatePark.html">Clinton State Park</a>, which provides over 400 campsites. There are some primitive sites, but most are for RVs. All are pay sites.</p>
